    <h2>Foundational Kuklos Property Dictatorship</h2>

    <p>
The Foundational Kuklos Property Dictatorship was established on 7/6/1444 AH. Initially, it was a secret organization with unclear public objectives. At the beginning of 1445 AH,
the organization announced its goal of funding and assisting other organizations or welcoming organizations that wished to end injustice and tyranny.
    </p>

    <p>
        The organization relied on funding loyal organizations and establishing strategic alliances,
        and adopted the principle of complete secrecy in its movements.
